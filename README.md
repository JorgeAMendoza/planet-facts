# Planet Information Website created with Next JS and CSS Modules

<div align="center"><img src="./project-images/presentation.gif" width=600 alt="gif of planet being demonstrated"></div>

The goal of the project is to create a functional website which displays various facts and images about planets in our solar system.

Three goals I aimed to achieve with this project are:

1. Get practice with Next JS by understanding how to set routes, create static pages, and get data from an API on each page with the props.
2. Use CSS modules to style the application instead of frameworks such as styled-components or bootstrap.
3. Make every webpage accessible to the best of my abilites.

## Techstack Used

Project was boostrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) using the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template, using most of the default configurations provided by the script.

The following are the main tools used to create the application.

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that is used to create server-side rendered applications.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress), a front-end testing tool to create integration and unit test.

Other tools used is [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) which is a way to write css in a more modular fashion. Libraries used include [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) which is used to call API endpoints.

## Running the Application

Once the application has been cloned to your local machine, navigate to the project directoy and run `npm i ` to install dependencies.

To run the application in **development mode**, run the command `npm run dev`, you can reach the page at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To run the production build of the applicaiton, run the command ``
